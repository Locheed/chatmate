# <a name="about"></a>About this project
This is a coding challenge project made for a [Codemate](http://www.codemate.fi) as a job applicant. Name of a project is heavily inspired by the company. =) Project requirement was just to make a basic frontend design/coding and a mockup JSON server (messages transfered with a REST API and JSON format). I took some more advanced approach and wanted to take a little more privileges to create also a small backend with user credentials login and a MongoDB as database. Note: This coding challenge was my first touch with a React and Redux, so there might be some not so best practices, but still I loved it. ❤️

* ***What this project showed to me?***
  * You can learn everything with a hard work and motivated mind.
  * There were some smaller obstacles and some huge obstacles that required a lot of research and reading, but I found a ways to solve these problems and that alone keeps your mind motivated.
  * A lot of JavaScript. :)
  * User authentication can really frustrate you.

* ***What next?***
  * Well hopefully this coding challenge is enough to get a job that I really love. And making this project I got an confirmation that this is the right track. I just love design and coding. Problem solving is something that really keeps my mind brisk and I like the feeling when I finally solve those problems.
  * This project I might improve later with a changing Socket.io to handle messaging and maybe some smaller features just for a fun and exercise.
  * I'm gonna keep learning everything that I can about React and keep training myself to come a better developer/designer/problem solver. I just loved React more after using Angular 2.
